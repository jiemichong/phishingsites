# phishingsites
Built and tested various models to identify and classify phishing sites.

This was part of a school project for Introduction to Machine learning, where we were expected to address a business problem using 4-5 machine learning techniques.

For our project, we decided to create a classifier that could detect if a given site is a phishing site, given the significant rise in the number of phishing incidents in recent years. 

To build the classifier, we built 5 models: Decision Trees, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks and K-nearest neighbours.

We also did data preprocessing and PCA. To optimize the models, we used GridSearchCV.


The dataset was taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/shashwatwork/phishing-dataset-for-machine-learning
